# Cookiecutter Template for a Python Template Repo

This repo contains a [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.0/) template for a Python Template Repo.
In [this](https://chris-clem.hashnode.dev/create-a-reasonable-python-template-project-with-poetry-pre-commit-and-github-actions-ck8jb6t9i00jlphs1askkcori) blog post, I describe how to create it.

Simply follow these steps to set up your project in minutes:
1. Install Cookiecutter
 ```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

2. Clone this repo
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/chris-clem/python-template-repo.git
```

3. Run Cookiecutter to create a new project from the template
 ```bash
cookiecutter python-template-repo
```
You will be asked for how you want to name the repo, the package, and the script.

The template also comes with a README containing setup instructions.
