# Cookiecutter Template for a Python Template Repo

This repo contains a [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template for a Python Template Repo.
In [this](https://chris-clem.github.io/posts/2020/04/kickstart-python-project/) blog post, I describe how to create it.

Simply follow these steps to set up your project in minutes:

1. Install Cookiecutter

 ```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

1. Run Cookiecutter to create a new project from the template

```bash
cookiecutter gh:chris-clem/python-template-repo
```

You will be asked for how you want to name the repo, the package, and the script.

The template also comes with a README containing setup instructions.
